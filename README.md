# SOC Automation Project


## PROJECT OBJECTIVE

To gain practical, hands-on experience in implementing and integrating various security tools for SOC Automation project. The goal is to enhance SOC automation capabilities, enabling more efficient detection, analysis, and response to ongoing threats. As a SOC analyst, the project focuses on configuring and managing an open-source SIEM platform (Wazuh) to centralize log management and security event analysis, automating threat detection and incident response workflows using Shuffle, and utilizing TheHive for coordinated incident management.

## TOOlS

- Wazuh: An open-source SIEM platform that provides comprehensive security monitoring, log analysis, and threat detection across various systems and environments.
- TheHive: An open-source incident response platform designed for managing, analyzing, and collaborating on security incidents and investigations.
- Shuffle: An automation tool that integrates with various security tools to streamline and automate response actions and workflows.
- Windows VM: A widely used operating system developed by Microsoft, offering a user-friendly interface and extensive compatibility with software applications.
- Mimikatz: A popular open-source tool used for extracting and manipulating authentication credentials on Windows systems, often used in penetration testing and security assessments.
- Digital Ocean: A cloud infrastructure provider offering scalable virtual servers (droplets) and other cloud-based services for deploying and managing applications.
- The VirusTotal: A free online service that analyzes files and URLs for malware and security threats using multiple antivirus engines and other security tools.

## SKILLS GAINED

- SIEM Configuration and Management: Configured and managed Wazuh SIEM for centralized log management and security event analysis.

- Automation of Threat Detection: Set up automated processes using Shuffle to integrate various security tools and workflows.

- Rule Creation and Tuning: Adjusted rule parameters to enhance the effectiveness of automated alerts and responses.

- Incident Analysis and Triage: Developed workflows and procedures for investigating and responding to alerts generated by automated systems.

- Threat Hunting and Detection Strategy: Employed automated detection techniques to identify potential security threats and vulnerabilities.

- Data Correlation and Event Analysis: Correlated security events from multiple sources to gain a comprehensive view of potential threats.
